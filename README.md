RuneForge is a no-code asset issuance platform designed specifically for the Runes protocol. It allows users to easily configure asset attributes (total supply, distribution rules, metadata) through a visual interface and automatically generates script code that complies with Runes standards. RuneForge lowers the development barrier, enabling individuals and businesses to easily and efficiently create and manage Runes assets.
